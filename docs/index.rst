Django-le-social
================

Django-le-social is an external registration helper for Django. It currently
lets you use Twitter (OAuth) and OpenID authentication, as well as traditional
registration.

Design
------

It's more a framework than a drop-in app in the sense that it won't create
any user data for you: when a user comes from an external authentication
source, django-le-social executes a method that **you** decide. There is no
user creation, no new model instance, no user login. You need to decide what
to do, mainly store the OAuth token or the OpenID data, create a user and log
him in.

The model structure is completely up to you: you can use django-le-social with
any user model or session backend, you should be able to plug it to almost any
existing project. If you can't, it's probably a bug -- please report back!

Django-le-social **doesn't add any settings**. While you can store some stuff
in the settings, it's not enforced. For application logic, we try to use
attributes and methods as much as possible.

Changes
-------

* 0.8:

  * The ``activate()`` method of ``le_social.registration.views.Activate`` now
    has access to the request parameters in ``self.request``, ``self.args``
    and ``self.kwargs``. This is useful if you need the request object for
    automatically logging the user in for instance.

  * Custom user model support in ``le_social.registration``. If your user
    model is created differently than with a username, an email and a password
    you need to override the registration form. Furthermore if your user
    doesn't have an ``is_active`` flag you need to override the ``activate()``
    method of the activation view.

* 0.7:

  * Fixes for Django 1.5 and Python 3.

* 0.6:

  * Travis tests
  * Django requirement bumped to 1.4
  * ``itsdangerous`` requirement dropped
 Â * ``twitter`` and ``python-openid`` requirements made optional: if you only
    use ``le_social.registration`` you don't need to install them.

* 0.5:

  * Tox tests for python 2.6 / 2,7 and Django 1.2 / 1.3 / trunk.
  * Changed the registration API, backwards-incompatible if you were using it
    but *much* simpler to use.

* 0.4:

  * Test suite
  * Django < 1.3 compatibility with django-cbv
  * "Traditional" registration support, ala django-registration

* 0.3:

  * switched from tweepy to twitter for Twitter authentication
  * added the ability to force the login on the twitter authorization screen

* 0.2:

  * renamed OpenID's and Twitter's ``Return`` views to ``Callback``
  * added ``build_callback`` for custom twitter callback URLs

* 0.1: initial version
