Django-le-social is an external registration helper for Django. It currently
lets you use Twitter (OAuth) and OpenID authentication, as well as traditional
registration.

It's more a framework than a drop-in app in the sense that it won't create
any user data for you: when a user comes from an external authentication
source, django-le-social executes a method that **you** decide. There is no
user creation, no new model instance, no user login. You need to decide what
to do, mainly store the OAuth token or the OpenID data, create a user and log
him in.
